                        The objective of this project was to follow a 
                        <a target="_blank" href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/">MIT App Inventor</a>
                        tutorial and then modify the final product of the tutorial. My team chose to follow and modify the 
                        <a target="_blank" href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/quizme.html"> QuizMe Tutorial</a>. 
                        We started by creating the baseball trivia game, as shown in the tutorial, 
                        then modified it by turning it into a Dublin High School trivia game, as well as adding a number of 
                        features including a score and timer. During the project, I participated in aconstant stream of 
                        communication with my partner in order to maintain a productive work environment so that we 
                        could remain on task and on schedule at all times. 
                        We worked together through the process of pair programming, 
                        and I was able to further my understanding of the core programming concepts, especially global variables. 
                        During this project, we had difficulty with time management and prioritization. We often found ourselves 
                        struggling to decide what features to work on next, and what was necessary or extremely favourable to add 
                        to our app. A specific challenge that we faced during this project was figuring out how to switch from our 
                        title screen to the game screen. 
                        We initially attempted to use the "screen initialize" block, but it didn't function properly. We ultimately made 
                        the decision to simply switch the code on the two screens by copying each block over, because we had been wasting 
                        days of classtime trying to figure out a different solution. This decision helped us to finish a lot of other 
                        features that we'd wanted to implement. Through this challenge, I learned how to problem solve when 
                        difficult situations arise where a decision has to be made.
