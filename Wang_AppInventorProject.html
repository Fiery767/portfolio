                    The objective of this project was to follow a MIT App Inventor tutorial and then modify the final product of the 
                    tutorial. My team chose to follow and modify the <a target="_blank" 
                    href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/quizme.html"> QuizMe Tutorial</a>. We started by creating the 
                    baseball trivia game, as shown in the tutorial, then modified it by turning it into a Dublin High School trivia 
                    game, as well as adding a number of features including a score and timer. During the project, I participated in a
                    constant stream of communication with my partner in order to maintain a productive work environment so that we 
                    could remain on task and on schedule at all times. We worked together through the process of pair programming, 
                    and I was able to further my understanding of the core programming concepts, especially global variables. A 
                    challenge we faced during this project was figuring out how to switch from our title screen to the game screen. 
                    We initially attempted to use the "screen initialize" block, but it didn't function properly. We ultimately made 
                    the decision to simply switch the code on the two screens by copying each block over, because we had been wasting 
                    days of classtime trying to figure out a different solution. This decision helped us to finish a lot of other 
                    features that we'd wanted to implement, and taught me about problem solving when difficult situations arise.
