		    <b>Hi. Welcome to my site.</b>
                        <br>
                        Games have shaped my life, and I have always wanted to affect others with games in the same way I have been 
                        affected. Ever since I was little, I've always had an interest in games. They fascinated me with their complex 
                        design, choices, characters, and stories. It is this interest which has led me to pursue a career in the games 
                        industry. Currently, I am exploring the computer science pathway through Project Lead the Way (PLTW)'s Engineering and 
                        Design Academy. I am enrolled in the Academy and their Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Applications course, and I have already taken Principles of Engineering, which has allowed me to 
                        explore the other fields of engineering and broaden my knowledge, as well as Computer Science Principles, which taught me basic coding principles, as well as some web development (allowing me to build this website!), and Python. Through Computer Science, my ultimate goal is to 
                        affect people with my work in the same positive ways that games affected me.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        I am dedicated, dependable, and cooperative. Throughout high school, I have been a member 
                        of the marching band, the 
                        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dhsirishguard.org/">Dublin High School Irish Guard</a>. Being a part of 
                        the band has taught me dedication 
                        through the long hours of practice outside of school. It has also helped me learn to cooperate with others, 
                        because as a member of the band, everyone depends on each other to be accountable and learn their music, and 
                        practice outside of the time we spend all together. For the past three seasons, I was a section leader for the 
                        bass drums, which is a five person section. Being on a bassline is essentially taking a melodic part composed 
                        of five notes, and dividing it up so each person plays one of the notes. We all depend on each other knowing and 
                        playing the right parts, otherwise the music won't sound good. As section leader, I cooperated with the members 
                        of my section to plan group practice times, and I also fostered accountability and constant improvement by 
                        encouraging everyone to practice on their own time, and at times assigning video homework. Overall, band has 
                        taught me a great deal about teamwork, committment, and leadership.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        I am also a disciplined and self-motivated worker. Throughout high school, I have consistently maintained a 4.0 
                        GPA, and I challenge myself as a learner and thinker through AP and honours courses. 
                        I constantly juggle my time between schoolwork, band, church, and personal time. I value constant
                        improvement and productivity, but I also believe in taking time to take care of personal matters and health. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Thanks for reading! To learn more about me, please explore the rest of my site.
