                        <strong>Hi. Welcome to my site.</strong>
                        <br>
                        Games have shaped my life, and I have always wanted to affect others with games in the same way I have been 
                        affected. Ever since I was little, I've always had an interest in games. They fascinated me with their complex 
                        design, choices, characters, and stories. It is this interest which has led me to pursue a career in the games 
                        industry. Currently, I am exploring the computer science pathway through Project Lead the Way's Engineering and 
                        Design Academy. I am enrolled in the Academy and their Computer Science Principles course, and I plan to take 
                        Computer Science Applications next year. I have already taken Principles of Engineering, which has allowed me to 
                        explore the other fields of engineering and broaden my knowledge. At the moment, I am self-studying through 
                        <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/">Harvard's edX CS50 course</a>, which,
                        in conjunction with my other regular school coursework, has taught time management and focus. Though my main 
                        focus has been computer science, I am also interested in audio engineering, including production and design. I 
                        am exploring the possibility of entering film and video production through audio design, and plan to take 
                        courses at a community college over the summer next year in order to further explore this interest. Whether I 
                        decide to enter games or film, my ultimate goal is to affect people with my work in the same positive ways that 
                        games and film affected me.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        I am dedicated, dependable, and cooperative. Throughout high school, I have been a member 
                        of the marching band, the 
                        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dhsirishguard.org/">Dublin High School Irish Guard</a>. Being a part of 
                        the band has taught me dedication 
                        through the long hours of practice outside of school. It has also helped me learn to cooperate with others, 
                        because as a member of the band, everyone depends on each other to be accountable and learn their music, and 
                        practice outside of the time we spend all together. For the past three seasons, I was a section leader for the 
                        bass drums, which is a five person section. Being on a bassline is essentially taking a melodic part composed 
                        of five notes, and dividing it up so each person plays one of the notes. We all depend on each other knowing and 
                        playing the right parts, otherwise the music won't sound good. As section leader, I cooperated with the members 
                        of my section to plan group practice times, and I also fostered accountability and constant improvement by 
                        encouraging everyone to practice on their own time, and at times assigning video homework. Overall, band has 
                        taught me a great deal about teamwork, committment, and leadership.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        I am also a disciplined and self-motivated worker. Throughout high school, I have consistently maintained a 4.0 
                        GPA, and I challenge myself as a learner and thinker through AP (Advanced Placement) and honours courses. 
                        I constantly juggle my time between schoolwork, band, church, and personal time. I value constant
                        improvement and productivity, but I also believe in taking time to take care of personal matters and health. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
