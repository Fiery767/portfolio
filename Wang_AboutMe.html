                    Games have shaped my life, and I have always wanted to affect others with games in the same way I have been 
                    affected. Ever since I was little, I've always had an interest in games. They fascinated me with their complex 
                    design, choices, characters, and stories. It is this interest which has led me to pursue a career in the games 
                    industry. Currently, I am exploring the computer science pathway through Project Lead the Way's Engineering and 
                    Design Academy. I am enrolled in the Academy and their Computer Science Principles course, and I plan to take 
                    Computer Science Applications next year. I have already taken Principles of Engineering, which has allowed me to 
                    explore the other fields of engineering and broaden my knowledge. At the moment, I am self-studying through 
                    <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/">Harvard's edX CS50 course</a>, which,
                    in conjunction with my other regular school coursework, has taught time management and focus. Though my main 
                    focus has been computer science, I am also interested in audio engineering, including production and design. I 
                    am exploring the possibility of entering film and video production through audio design, and plan to take 
                    courses at a community college over the summer next year in order to further explore this interest. Whether I 
                    decide to enter games or film, my ultimate goal is to affect people with my work in the same positive ways that 
                    games and film affected me.

                    <br/>
                    I am dedicated, dependable, and cooperative. Throughout high school, I have been a member 
                    of the marching band, the Dublin High School Irish Guard. Being a part of the band has taught me dedication 
                    through the long hours of practice outside of school. It has also helped me learn to cooperate with others, 
                    because as a member of the band, everyone depends on each other to be accountable and learn their music, and 
                    practice outside of the time we spend all together. For the past three seasons, I was a section leader for the 
                    bass drums, which is a five person section. The way being on a bassline works is that it's essentially one part 
                    split across five drums and five people. We all depend on each other knowing and playing the right parts, 
                    otherwise the music won't sound good. As section leader, I cooperated with the members of my section to plan 
                    group practice times, and I also fostered accountability and constant improvement by encouraging everyone to 
                    practice, and at times assigning video homework. Overall, band has taught me a great deal about committment, 
                    teamwork, and leadership.

                    I am also a disciplined and self-motivated worker. Throughout high school, I have consistently maintained a 4.0 
                    GPA, and I challenge myself as a learner and thinker through AP (Advanced Placement) and honours courses. 
                    I constantly juggle my time between schoolwork, band, church, and personal time. I value constant
                    improvement and productivity, but I also believe in taking time to take care of personal matters and health.
