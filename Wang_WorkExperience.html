                In early 2018, I was given the opportunity to visit the Cisco Systems Headquarters in San Jose, CA. Here
                I was able to meet several industry leaders and learn about ongoing technology they are working on. Particularly
                interesting were the "smart cities" they were developing, which allowed lights and parking all over a city to be
                controlled with the click of a button. It proved just how much can be accomplished with technology, and how far
                technology has come since electricity was first discovered. This visit allowed me to see how a regular workplace
                functioned, and also allowed me to learn more about current technology. We also participated in an activity in which
                we wrote out the steps to a simple action such as making a sandwich or building a snowman, then several of our peers
                would try to expose flaws in the process, simulating how hackers think, and how those working in security counter
                them. It was an extremely interesting and enlightening experience, and definitely left me wanting to learn more
                about internet security.

                Back in October 2017, two speakers from BSK Associates came to speak to my class. BSK Associates is an engineering
                consulting firm based in Livermore, CA. They work in geotechnical, environmental, and materials engineering, and are
                an employee owned company. They spoke to us about different techniques they used in the field to analyze soil
                samples, as well as local projects they worked on, including a nearby water park called The Wave. I was inspired
                that they were able to work on such a large scale project despite being an independent firm. I was previously
                unaware that engineering firms such as this existed, and so meeting people who are out there in the workforce was
                very insightful. Several of their current employees are alumni from my school, which was an encouragement to me that
                they were able to find local work and that the program introduced them to industry contacts and gave them the
                opportunity to break into the engineering field.

                In November 2018, we had a speaker come in who had gone through the ROTC program and was in the Air Force as an
                engineer working in intelligence operations. He spoke to us about how the ROTC works and the opportunity available
                for engineering students to have their tuition paid by the government if they enroll in the Air Force. Though I
                would be unable to go this route without first becoming a U.S. citizen and going through that process, it was
                interesting to see that this option is available. The presentation given showed me how there is a wide range of
                options available to engineers, including various careers and fields.

            <br/>
                In January 2019, I had the opportunity to tour the UC Davis campus. We were able to tour the campus, including the
                engineering facilities. We learned about how the application and transfer process works, and in general what the
                environment of the school is like. Touring the campus really allowed me to see if I would be interested in attending
                UC Davis. We were also able to talk to current students and ask them about their experiences at the school.
            <br/>
            <br/>
                During the 2018-19 school year, I had the pleasure of being mentored by Roddy Kwan, a former Engineering Director
                from Qualcomm, as part of the Project Lead the Way Engineering Academy. Throughout the year, he has taught me so
                much ranging from resume building and interview skills, to simple time management and goal setting. As someone who
                worked in the engineering field, he's been able to offer a lot of insight as to what being an engineer actually
                entails. Thanks to his mentorship, I've been able to learn about the workplace, and the world beyond high school.

                On November 5th, 2019, my Computer Science Applications class had the opportunity to hear a presentation from
                a speaker from Uber AI Labs named Jacob Yosinski. Mr. Yosinski spoke to us about the differences between AI and
                machine learning, and showed us an example of "computer vision", where different levels of neurons found different
                patterns in an inputted image. The input could even be from a video feed, as Mr. Yosinski demonstrated. The lowest
                level neurons found simple patterns like areas of light/dark contrast, whereas higher level neurons were able to look
                for more complicated patterns, like human faces. He also taught us about how AI is able to do language modeling
                through machine learning. By feeding the AI text from the internet it can create new content, such as fake
                Wikipedia pages or television/movie scripts. Learning about AI and machine learning was helpful in that it let me
                see what the current state of the technology is.              
           <br/>
           <br/>
                During the summer of 2019, I was able to intern at a software development startup called
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.maskil.church">Maskil</a>. It was founded by a friend of Roddy's, who invited me on to the
                project as a way to gain real world experience working in the software engineering field. Over the summer, I was
                mentored and assigned software engineering tasks to complete. It was unlike anything I'd ever done before. Even just
                setting up my local development environment, which seemed simple enough, took two weeks to finish. Until that point,
                I hadn't even begun working on the actual software yet. Jumping into working on a live project that was available to and
                used by the public was difficult, yet fun. It was so satisfying to see code I'd written be published onto a live site
                for the world to see, but the process of figuring out how to implement features, coding, debugging, rinse and repeat, was
                exhausting. Along with that, I had to learn to manage my code and avoid breaking the whole project when I merged my work
                with the main codebase. But ultimately, it was an amazing experience and definitely taught me a lot about what actually
                working in the industry is like.
