                Although I cannot work in the United States due to my status as a temporary resident,  I have still been looking for 
                opportunities to gain hands on experience in the working field. Over the past few years, I have been able to hear 
                from several guest speakers about their experiences in engineering careers. This has allowed me to gain more insight 
                as to what a job in engineering entails. I was also able to visit a live workplace and tour the grounds. Even 
                without working, I have been able to gain a lot of experience just by meeting people from the industry.

                In early 2018, I was given the opportunity to visit the Cisco Systems Headquarters in San Jose, CA. Here 
                I was able to meet several industry leaders and learn about ongoing technology they are working on. Particularly 
                interesting were the "smart cities" they were developing, which allowed lights and parking all over a city to be 
                controlled with the click of a button. It proved just how much can be accomplished with technology, and how far 
                technology has come since electricity was first discovered. This visit allowed me to see how a regular workplace 
                functioned, and also allowed me to learn more about current technology. We also participated in an activity in which 
                we wrote out the steps to a simple action such as making a sandwich or building a snowman, then several of our peers 
                would try to expose flaws in the process, simulating how hackers think, and how those working in security counter 
                them. It was an extremely interesting and enlightening experience, and definitely left me wanting to learn more 
                about internet security.

                Back in October, 2017, two speakers from BSK Associates came to speak to my class. BSK Associates is an engineering 
                consulting firm based in Livermore, CA. They work in geotechnical, environmental, and materials engineering, and are 
                an employee owned company. They spoke to us about different techniques they used in the field to analyze soil 
                samples, as well as local projects they worked on, including a nearby water park called The Wave. I was inspired 
                that they were able to work on such a large scale project despite being an independent firm. I was previously 
                unaware that engineering firms such as this existed, and so meeting people who are out there in the workforce was 
                very insightful. Several of their current employees are alumni from my school, which was an encouragement to me that 
                they were able to find local work and that the program introduced them to industry contacts and gave them the 
                opportunity to break into the engineering field.

                This past November, we had a speaker come in who had gone through the ROTC program and was in the Air Force as an 
                engineer working in intelligence operations. He spoke to us about how the ROTC works and the opportunity available 
                for engineering students to have their tuition paid by the government if they enroll in the Air Force. Though I 
                would be unable to go this route without first becoming a U.S. citizen and going through that process, it was 
                interesting to see that this option is available. The presentation given showed me how there is a wide range of 
                options available to engineers, including various careers and fields.

                Throughout this school year, I have the pleasure of being mentored by Roddy Kwan, a retired engineering director 
                from Qualcomm, as part of the engineering academy at my school. So far, he has taught me about how to define success 
                based on what I value. I have also learned about exactly working in engineering entails, and the different 
                opportunities that are available.
