                        The objective of this project was to create a device that could detect a cookie, move it to a secondary area, 
                        detect when three cookies were in the secondary area, then transport them all together to a final packaging area. 
                        I was the project manager for this project, so I fostered a productive environment each day we worked in 
                        class, and assigned tasks as needed. I oversaw our project timeline to ensure that we were on track to 
                        meet our deadline. I was also the main programmer, so I wrote the majority of the program that was 
                        ultimately used to run our machine. A challenge I faced was that I was largely unable to test my code's 
                        functionality until the physical model was built, so I had to use my knowledge of how the program would 
                        interact with the motors to write the majority of the code rather than just guessing and checking using the 
                        model. Once the prototype was built, I worked with the rest of my team to make necessary adjustments to the 
                        code based on how the prototype worked and its specific dimensions. 
                        We used <a target="_blank" href="http://www.robotc.net/">RobotC</a> software to code our program, and 
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vexrobotics.com/">VEX</a> parts to build our prototype.
