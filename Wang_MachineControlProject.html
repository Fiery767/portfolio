                    The objective of this project was to create a device that could detect a cookie, move it to a secondary area, 
                    detect when three cookies were in the secondary area, then transport them all together to a final packaging area. 
                    I was the project manager for this project, so I made sure everyone was on task in class, and kept track of what 
                    we had to get done each day in order to finish on time. I was also the main programmer, so I wrote the majority 
                    of the program that was ultimately used to run our machine.  I was largely unable to test until the physical 
                    model was built, so I used my knowledge of how the program would interact with the motors to write the majority 
                    of the code. Once the prototype was built, I worked with the rest of my team to make necessary adjustments to the 
                    code based on what we observed. We used RobotC software for this project.
